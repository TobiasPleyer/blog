My blog on Github
=================

I decided to make all my blog content and the source code behind it
publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/TobiasPleyer/blog). I
think I will have more benefits from it than drawbacks.

On the one hand, this decision truely follows the idea of open source -
don't hide anything and make everything available. But on the other hand
it also means a lot of advantages for myself:

> 1.  I can use GitHub as an extra backup facility to be sure a hard
>     disk crash won't hurt me
> 2.  I can access my blog from everywhere in the world whenever I want
>     to
> 3.  I have a source control and history available
> 4.  I can make references to configuration files on my blog and be
>     sure they will stay up-to-date
> 5.  People can make corrections or maybe even contributions easily and
>     in a controlled manner

The only drawback I can see is that everybody has full access to what I
have written, but in a way that is already the case when you have a
website, so not much of a difference here I guess...
