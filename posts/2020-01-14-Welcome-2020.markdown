# Welcome 2020

2020 is here! For half a year I haven't posted anything new on this blog. The
last 6 months were pretty exciting a new for me.

**I became a father**. My wonderful daughter Joanna was born on 14th of October
2019. I am happy happy to have her and to see her grow up. Today on the day she
it's been 3 month that she saw the light of the day. I wish her all the best
for her journey through life, most of all health.

I also switched my job. Since January this year I am a full stack web developer
in Haskell! There are many new things to learn and I am motivated to get to
know this fascinating technology stack.

I hope I will be able to post more regularily again this year.
