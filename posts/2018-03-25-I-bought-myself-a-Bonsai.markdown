I bought myself a Bonsai
========================

I was always fascinated by the art of bonsai. When I was still a kid I
convinced my parents to buy me one. I died within the first year.

After that I didn't buy any trees anymore for many years, until this
year, when I was tempted to buy one again. I was looking so cute and I
decided to take it.

The plant is a little Szechuan pepper from China, approx. 3 years old.

The Beginning
-------------

These are the pictures of the plant as I bought it.

I invested in a couple of tools, not much just enough to do the wiring
and ferilize the tree. Here are the tools I bought

The tools are:

> -   2 concave pliers
> -   3 different strengths of bonsai wire
> -   Bonsai liquid fertilizer
> -   Drainage screens for re-potting

After the first wiring

After cleaning the foliage and my first attempt of wiring the tree
looked like that
