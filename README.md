# Github mirror of my local blog setup

This github project shows all the settings alongside the content of my blog
at [blog.tpleyer.de](http://blog.tpleyer.de).

The blog is a collection of
static websites generated by [_Pelican_](https://blog.getpelican.com).
The _Pelican_ settings as well as the restructured text blog posts are all
available. This means if you have [_Python_](https://www.python.org), 
_Pelican_ and [_Apache_](https://www.apache.org) installed, the following
commands should give you a private copy of my blog on _localhost_:
```
~$ git clone https://github.com/TobiasPleyer/blog.git
~$ cd blog
~$ make html
~$ ./apache_develop.sh rsync
~$ ./apache_develop.sh start
```

Be sure that you have the rights to start the _Apache_ server on your
machine (use _sudo_ if necessary).

If you intend to publish the content on a real server run
```
~$ make publish
```
instead of make html.
