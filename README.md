# Github mirror of my blog setup

This github project shows all the settings alongside the content of my blog
at [blog.tpleyer.de](http://blog.tpleyer.de).

The blog is a collection of static websites generated by
[_Hakyll_](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). My _Hakyll_ settings as well as the
markdown sources for every blog post are all available in this repository.

## Generating the sources

The following commands will generate the blog posts in HTML format under the
folder **\_site**:

### Using [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/TobiasPleyer/blog.git
~$ cd blog
~$ stack build
~$ stack exec site build
```

### Using [Nix](https://nixos.org/) and cabal

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/TobiasPleyer/blog.git
~$ cd blog
~$ nix-shell
[nix-shell]$ cabal configure && cabal build
[nix-shell]$ cabal run site -- build
```

At this point you can host and browse the website locally on your machine by
executing one of the following commands:

### stack

```
~$ stack exec site watch
```

### Nix

```
[nix-shell]$ cabal run site -- watch
```

At this point, if you enter *localhost:8000* in your browser, you should be
able to see and browse the website.
