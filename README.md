# Github mirror of my blog setup

This github project shows all the settings alongside the content of my blog
at [blog.tpleyer.de](http://blog.tpleyer.de).

The blog is a collection of static websites generated by
[_Hakyll_](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). The _Hakyll_ settings as well as the
markdown source files for every blog posts are all available on this
repository.

## Generating the sources

If you just want the HTML files the following commands will generate them and
then put them under the folder **output**:

```
~$ git clone https://github.com/TobiasPleyer/blog.git
~$ cd blog
~$ stack build
~$ stack exec site build
```

If you want to have a look at the site locally now, just run

```
~$ stack exec site watch
```

You can now navigate to localhost:8000 in your browser.
