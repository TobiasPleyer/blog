:summary: A few words about me

Hi and welcome to my blog!

I am a software engineer currently located in Munich, Germany. I am fascinated by everything related
to programming. I like to write about my thoughts, struggles and findings. Amongst my interests are:
Python, user interfaces (graphical and textual), parsers and operating systems. If I'm not programming
I enjoy spending some time with my wife and my dog or create something with my hands (mostly out of
wood).

I graduated in physics, but came to realize very fast that programming was what I wanted to do.

If you like the blog and like to get in touch, contribute or just be inspired feel free to checkout my `GitHub`_. This repository is the configuration I use to generate this blog and it will change with the blog, giving a nice extra history feature to the blog.
