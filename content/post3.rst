:summary: I am publishing my blog source on GitHub

I decided to make all my blog content and the source code behind it publicly
available on `GitHub`_. I think I will have more benefits from it than drawbacks.

On the one hand, this decision truely follows the idea of open source - don't hide
anything and make everything available. But on the other hand it also means a
lot of advantages for myself:

    #. I can use GitHub as an extra backup facility to be sure a hard disk crash won't hurt me
    #. I can access my blog from everywhere in the world whenever I want to
    #. I have a source control and history available
    #. I can make references to configuration files on my blog and be sure they will stay up-to-date
    #. People can make corrections or maybe even contributions easily and in a controlled manner

The only drawback I can see is that everybody has full access to what I have written, but
in a way that is already the case when you have a website, so not much of a difference here
I guess...
