Hi. My name is Tobias and I am a software engineer currently located in Munich,
Germany. I have my Master of Science in physics, but quickly came to realize
that programming is what I want to do most. I am fascinated by everything
related to programming. I like to write about my thoughts, struggles and
findings. Amongst my interests are: Python, user interfaces (graphical and
textual), parsers and operating systems, but my biggest personal pleasure is
learning more about functional programming. If I'm not programming I enjoy
spending some time with my wife and my dog or create something with my hands
(mostly out of wood).
